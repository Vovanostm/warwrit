# Changelog

Notable changes to the repository's tooling, gates and delivered behavior. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the
project has no released versions yet, so entries stay under _Unreleased_ with
their merge date. Earlier history is in the Git log and merged pull requests.

## Unreleased

### Added

- 2026-09-29, #125: fallow (`pnpm check:dead-code` in `pnpm verify`,
  `pnpm check:changes` on pull requests, `pnpm report:quality`) and ast-grep
  code-shape rules with rule tests (`pnpm check:patterns`).
- 2026-09-29, #128: `pnpm test:coverage` (v8, no threshold) as evidence for
  `fallow health --coverage`; specifications for encounter HTTP authorization,
  the encounter command guard and duty-change learning settlement.

- 2026-09-29: `pnpm agent:status` prints live main, CI, open pull requests,
  active unmerged branches with their paths and the next migration number from
  git and gh, replacing hand-written status readback.

### Fixed

- 2026-09-29, #128: combat initiative ties, AI targets and canonical replay order
  no longer depend on the host locale (`compareCodeUnits`); stress digest
  unchanged for existing ids.
- 2026-09-29, #128: CI now runs the encounter and OIDC PostgreSQL specifications
  in `pnpm test:migrations`; they were skipped because only `DATABASE_URL` was set.

### Changed

- 2026-09-29: local containers run on colima; see
  [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/engineering/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md#container-runtime-colima).
- 2026-09-29, #125: seven internal-only game-core exports removed; `ajv` and
  `fast-check` declared by testkit, which imports them.
- 2026-09-29, #128: encounter routes authenticate in one encapsulated Fastify
  hook; `protocol` owns the encounter id format.
